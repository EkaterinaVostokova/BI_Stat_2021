1. The aim of the project was to analyze Olympic athletes data. 
2. Out of 16 tasks, tasks 13 and 16 were not done
3. Search of invalid values was mostly done through analysis of unique values in each column, checking most non-sense ones.
4. During that, a lot of interesting discoveries were made - Olympics once had art competitions, and "athletes" could be over 80 years old.
5.  For task 14 means of two samples were compared using t-test and then by building boxplots
6.  For the majority of tasks, dplyr library was used.
